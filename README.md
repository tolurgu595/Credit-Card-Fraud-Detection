## Introduction

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. Credit card fraud is a significant issue affecting businesses and consumers, and this project provides a solution for automated fraud detection.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python (version X.X.X)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Flask, SHAP, etc.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection.git


## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

Open and run the Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

After training, the best-performing model is saved as a pickle file.

Deploy the model using Flask for real-time fraud detection.

## Project Structure
data/: Contains the dataset used for this project.
notebooks/: Jupyter Notebook files for data preprocessing and model training.
models/: Saved machine learning models.
app/: Flask web application for model deployment.
templates/: HTML templates for the web interface.
Data
The dataset used for this project is an open-source dataset containing credit card transaction information.

## Methodology
We employ a combination of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to build and deploy the fraud detection model.

## Model Training
The model is trained using various machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

## Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Model Interpretation
We use SHAP (SHapley Additive explanations) methodology to gain insights into the model's predictions and feature importance.

## Model Deployment
The best-performing model is deployed using Flask to provide real-time credit card fraud detection.
